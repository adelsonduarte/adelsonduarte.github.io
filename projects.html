							<h2 id="3">An IoT energy consumption system based on Powerline communication.</h2>
							
							<div class="box">
								<p>This project was a result of my<strong> masters</strong>. It can be split into <strong>circuit design, firmware development</strong> and web service application. The circuit shown below uses a microcontroller <strong>MSP430AFE253 from Texas Instruments (TI), a switching power supply based on UCC28910 (TI), analog circuits</strong> to measure voltage and current, to modulate and demodulate measured data and set it properly within powerlines.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="box">
								<p>Firmware programming</strong> was made to acquire voltage and current samples, output <strong>PWM</strong> carrier signal and <strong>digitalized data (UART)</strong> for modulation circuit, <strong>to control</strong> the amplifier gain of the demodulation stage and select the carrier frequency by <strong> sensing the channel noise</strong>. </p>

								<p>In order to verify the waveform of the measured signal, I did a <strong>test bench using LABVIEW</strong>, as shown below.</p>

							<div class="box">
								<p>Finally, the modulation and demodulation circuit was duplicated and attached on <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>. Both module were connected to the powerlines, and the measured digitalized data was received by Raspberry Pi and <strong>sent to a Flask web service, based on REST, using python language</strong>. </p>

							<h2 id="2">Circuit design for autonomous sensor in industry 4.0</h2>
							<div class="box">
								<p>This work was done in a public-private cooperation between <strong>TECHPLUS - Campinas</strong> and <strong>FAPESP</strong>. The main objective was evaluate the application of thermal <strong>Energy Harvesting</strong> to supply an <strong>autonomous wireless sensor node</strong>. I was responsible for designing a power management circuit that interfaces the <strong> thermoelectric generator</strong> and the wireless sensor node. Three DC-DC converter were evaluated: <strong>LTC3108 (Analog Devices), MP3414 (Monolithic Power Systems) and BQ25570 (TI)</strong>. The circuit shown below is a DC-DC converter using LTC3108 that presented the best performance in our evaluation.<strong> A supercapacitor</strong> was used to store the harvested energy and to supply the autonomous sensor.</p>

							<h2 id="5">Winner of the 2nd CubeDesign! Cubsat project</h2>
							<div class="box">
								<p>I participated of the 2nd CubeDesign Cubsat project organizated by the <strong>National Institute for Space Research (INPE)</strong> by means of participating in an extracurricular team at Unicamp in space-modeling. In this project, I was responsible for the <strong>Energy harvesting module</strong>. The energy harvested by <strong>solar panels</strong> was used to recharge the Cubesat's battery pack. The current and the voltage of the bateries were processed by STM32F103. The developed Cubesat was subjected to a series of tests, including sensor telemetry, control of a reaction wheel and antenna ejection. The team that demonstrated the best outcome was ours and as a result, </strong>we received the <a href="https://www.fee.unicamp.br/noticias/2019/11/2a-cubedesign-premio-inpe-para-equipe-antares-unicamp">first place</a></strong></p>.

									<p>I also enjoy to teach electronics. This is an extensive and difficult task which I receive great pleasure facing. I had an opportunity to <strong>teach basic electronics focused on prototype development using KICAD EDA.</strong> We <strong> worked together</strong> to build a <strong>relay interfacing with ESP32, from the concept to the production.</strong> Some picture was taken and are shown below.

								<p>
								Moreover, I've participated in teaching program (PED) at School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UNICAMP. I've been working as assistant teacher on Electronics - Theory and Laboratory lectures. During one year and a half, I've mentored undergraduate students
								in electronic topics. such as transistors operation and analysis, PN junction concept, Operational amplifier topologies. I've written modern simulation study cases in order to approach
								the new students mindset to the concepts of electronics.</p>
