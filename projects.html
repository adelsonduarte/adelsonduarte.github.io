							<h2 id="3">An IoT energy consumption system based on Powerline communication.</h2>
							<div class="box">
								<p>his project was a result of my<strong> masters</strong>. It can be split into <strong>circuit design/firmware development</strong> and web service application. The circuit shown below uses a microcontroller <strong>MSP430AFE253 from Texas Instruments (TI), a switching power supply based on UCC28910 (TI), analog circuits</strong> to measure voltage and current, to modulate and demodulate measured data and set it properly within powerlines.<strong></p>
							</div>
							<div class-"box">
								<p>Firmware programming</strong> was made to acquire voltage and current samples, output <strong>PWM</strong> carrier signal and <strong>digitalized data (UART)</strong> for modulation circuit, <strong>to control</strong> the amplifier gain of the demodulation stage and select the carrier frequency by <strong> sensing the channel noise</strong>. </p>

								<p>In order to verify the waveform of the measured signal, I did a <strong>test bench using LABVIEW</strong>, as shown below.</p>

							<div class="box">
								<p>Finally, the modulation and demodulation circuit was duplicated and attached on <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>. Both module were connected to the powerlines, and the measured digitalized data was received by Raspberry Pi and <strong>sent to a Flask web service, based on REST, using python language</strong>. </p>

							<h2 id="2">Circuit design for autonomous sensor in industry 4.0</h2>
							<div class="box">
								<p>This work was done in a public-private cooperation between <strong>a local company</strong> and <strong>FAPESP</strong>. The main objective was evaluate the application of thermal <strong>Energy Harvesting</strong> to supply an <strong>autonomous wireless sensor node</strong>. I was responsible for designing a power management circuit that interfaces the <strong> thermoelectric generator</strong> and the wireless sensor node. Three DC-DC converter were evaluated: <strong>LTC3108 (Analog Devices), MP3414 (Monolithic Power Systems) and BQ25570 (TI)</strong>. The circuit shown below is a DC-DC converter using LTC3108 that presented the best performance in our evaluation.<strong> A supercapacitor</strong> was used to store the harvested energy and to supply the autonomous sensor.</p>

							<h2 id="5">Winner of the 2nd CubeDesign! Cubsat project</h2>
							<div class="box">
								<p>I participated of the 2nd CubeDesign Cubsat project organizated by the <strong>National Institute for Space Research (INPE)</strong> by means of participating in an extracurricular team at Unicamp in space-modeling. In this project, I was responsible for the <strong>Energy harvesting module</strong>. The energy harvested by <strong>solar panels</strong> was used to recharge the Cubesat's battery pack. The current and the voltage of the bateries were processed by STM32F103. The developed Cubesat was subjected to a series of tests, including sensor telemetry, control of a reaction wheel and antenna ejection. The team that demonstrated the best outcome was ours and as a result, </strong>we received the <a href="https://www.fee.unicamp.br/noticias/2019/11/2a-cubedesign-premio-inpe-para-equipe-antares-unicamp">first place</a></strong></p>.

									<p>I also enjoy to teach electronics. This is an extensive and difficult task which I receive great pleasure facing. I had an opportunity to <strong>teach basic electronics focused on prototype development using KICAD EDA.</strong> We <strong> worked together</strong> to build a <strong>relay interfacing with ESP32, from the concept to the production.</strong> Some picture was taken and are shown below.

								Moreover, I had the opportunity to participate in teaching intership program (PED) at UNICAMP. I and other assistants supported with the main teachers on Electronics I lecture. We were responsible for correcting completed activities and providing adequate support when requested by students.</p>

								<h2 id="1">Signal processing circuits for reconfigurable smart sensors </h2>
                                                        <div class="box">
								<p>This is what  I am working on throughout my <strong>Ph.D</strong>. I am working with precision analog circuits for a novel multi-sensor structure. This work is a contribution to food sector, precisely for precision agriculture. The objective is to develop a <strong>smart sensor</strong> capable of measuring temperature and moisture content of stored grains. The initial results of the novel structure can be found <a href="https://www.sensorsportal.com/HTML/DIGEST/november_2020/Vol_246/P_3180.pdf">here</a>.</p>
